## Placeholder Replacement

Until you have the actual images, the website is using placeholders. These placeholders should be replaced with real images before the website goes live.

## Alternative Image Sources

If you don't have your own images, you can find suitable travel images from:

1. Stock photo websites (Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, etc.)
2. Free stock photo sites (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay)
3. India Tourism official resources (with proper permissions)

Make sure all images represent India accurately and positively, showcasing its cultural diversity and natural beauty.

## Image Acquisition Guidelines for New Destinations

When sourcing images for the new destinations, consider the following:

### For Uttarakhand Images:
- Rishikesh: Include images of the Ganges River, suspension bridges (Laxman Jhula/Ram Jhula), yoga retreats, white water rafting, and evening Ganga Aarti ceremonies
- Nainital: Focus on Naini Lake, mall road, snow-capped mountain views, and boating activities

### For Himachal Pradesh Images:
- Shimla: Include colonial architecture, Mall Road, snow-covered landscapes (if winter), and Christ Church
- Manali: Show Solang Valley, snow activities, Hadimba Temple, and river rafting

### For International Destinations:
- Thailand: Mix of temples (Wat Pho, Wat Arun), beaches (Phi Phi, Phuket), markets, and cultural experiences
- Dubai: Modern architecture (Burj Khalifa, Palm Jumeirah), desert safaris, luxury shopping, and waterparks
- Australia: Sydney Opera House, Harbor Bridge, Great Barrier Reef, wildlife, and Melbourne cityscapes

### Image Selection Tips:
1. Select images that show both landscapes and people enjoying activities
2. Include a mix of cultural, adventure, and relaxation themes
3. Ensure images are high-quality and professionally composed
4. Prefer authentic travel photos rather than heavily edited stock photos
5. Ensure proper licensing for all images used commercially
