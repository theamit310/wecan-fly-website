- **Optimization**: Compress images for web use without significant loss of quality

## Placeholder Replacement

Until you have the actual images, the website is using placeholders. These placeholders should be replaced with real images before the website goes live.

## Alternative Image Sources

If you don't have your own images, you can find suitable travel images from:

1. Stock photo websites (Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, etc.)
2. Free stock photo sites (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay)
3. India Tourism official resources (with proper permissions)

Make sure all images represent India accurately and positively, showcasing its cultural diversity and natural beauty.
